Calculated yarn size is: {{size}}
<br/>
Yarn counts used by this calculator:
<ul>
	<li><em>Cotton</em> is the number of 840-yd hanks per pound.</li>
	<li><em>Linen</em> is the number of 300-yd hanks per pound.</li>
	<li><em>Silk</em> is the number of 840-yd hanks per pound.</li>
	<li><em>Wool</em> is the number of 560-yd hanks per pound.</li>
</ul>
There are many other yarn counts out there, but these are the ones with which weaving yarns seem to be typically labeled.
<br/>
<em>Note:</em> Wool puts the ply count first, while other fibers put it second (after the /).
